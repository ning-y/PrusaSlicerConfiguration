* Pre-commit hook

The pre-commit hook ensures that the configuration does not include information about the physical printer e.g. a /populated/ ~printhost_apikey~ field.

This pre-commit hook is recorded in a non-standard subdirectory, ~.githooks/~.
This ensures that the pre-commit hook itself is committed as part of the repository, because the default behavior is to keep it strictly client-side and outside the repository.
Therefore, to enable this pre-commit hook, configure git to use this non-standard subdirectory,

#+begin_example bash
git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/
#+end_example
